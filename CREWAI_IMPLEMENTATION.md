# CrewAI Multi-Agent RAG Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete - OpenWebUI Integrated!

The CrewAI agentic orchestration framework has been successfully integrated into your RAG system:
- ✅ **OpenWebUI now uses CrewAI multi-agent system by default**
- ✅ All conversation memory features preserved
- ✅ Standalone `/ask-crewai` endpoint also available
- ✅ Existing `/ask` and `/chat` endpoints unchanged

---

## 🤖 Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

Your system now includes a **3-agent crew** that works sequentially:

1. **Research Agent** (`research_specialist`)
   - **Role**: Document Research Specialist
   - **Goal**: Analyze documents and extract detailed information
   - **Capabilities**: 
     - Extracts full names with titles (H.E., Dr., Chairman, etc.)
     - Identifies organizations and departments
     - Captures specific dates, numbers, and facts
     - Finds key relationships and direct quotes

2. **Synthesis Agent** (`synthesis_expert`)
   - **Role**: Information Synthesis Expert
   - **Goal**: Create comprehensive, accurate answers
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Transforms analyzed data into clear answers
     - Includes specific details with proper formatting
     - Cites sources appropriately
     - Maintains faithfulness to source material

3. **Quality Agent** (`quality_assurance`)
   - **Role**: Quality Assurance Specialist
   - **Goal**: Validate and improve answer quality
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Verifies accuracy and completeness
     - Checks for proper citations
     - Ensures specific details are included
     - Identifies missing information

## 📡 New Endpoint: `/ask-crewai`

### Usage

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/ask-crewai \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Who issued the Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards?", "top_k": 5}'
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "question": "Your question here",
  "top_k": 5  // Optional: number of documents to retrieve
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "answer": "Quality-validated answer with citations...",
  "retrieved_nodes": 10,
  "method": "crewai_multi_agent",
  "agents_used": [
    "research_specialist",
    "synthesis_expert", 
    "quality_assurance"
  ],
  "workflow": "sequential",
  "citations": [...],
  "reranked": true,
  "reranker_type": "similarity"
}
```

## 🔄 Workflow Pipeline

### OpenWebUI & `/ask-crewai` Process (CrewAI Multi-Agent):

1. **Retrieve** - Get initial candidates using vector similarity (over-fetch 2x)
2. **Re-rank** - Apply Cohere or similarity-based reranking
3. **Research** - Research Agent analyzes documents
4. **Synthesize** - Synthesis Agent creates answer with conversation context
5. **Validate** - Quality Agent checks and improves
6. **Return** - Final validated answer with citations
7. **Memory** - Update conversation memory (OpenWebUI only)

### Endpoint Comparison:

| Endpoint | Speed | Quality | Memory | Agents | Use Case |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| `/ask` | ⚡ Fast (~2-3s) | ✅ Good | ❌ No | Direct LLM | Quick queries |
| `/chat` | ⚡ Fast (~2-3s) | ✅ Good | ✅ Yes | Direct LLM | Conversations |
| `/ask-crewai` | 🐢 Slower (~30-60s) | ✨ Excellent | ❌ No | 3 Agents | Complex questions |
| **OpenWebUI** | 🐢 Slower (~30-60s) | ✨ Excellent | ✅ Yes | **3 Agents** | **Main Interface** |

---

## 🎯 When to Use Each Endpoint

### Use **OpenWebUI** at http://localhost:3000 (Primary Interface)
- ✅ **Best choice for end users**
- ✅ CrewAI multi-agent system (Research + Synthesis + Quality)
- ✅ Full conversation memory
- ✅ Automatic citations and sources
- ✅ Fallback to direct LLM if CrewAI fails
- ⚠️ Slower (~30-60s per response due to 3-agent workflow)

### Use `/ask` API (Fast, Stateless)
- Quick factual queries via API
- When speed is priority
- Stateless questions
- Direct LLM (no agents)

### Use `/chat` API (Fast, With Memory)
- Multi-turn conversations via API
- Follow-up questions
- Session-based interactions
- Direct LLM (no agents)

### Use `/ask-crewai` API (Thorough, Multi-Agent, No Memory)
- Same CrewAI quality as OpenWebUI
- No conversation memory (stateless)
- For testing/comparing agent performance

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Configuration

All agents use:
- **LLM**: `ollama/llama3.2:1b`
- **Context Window**: 4096 tokens
- **Process**: Sequential (Research → Synthesis → Quality)
- **Verbose Mode**: Enabled for debugging

### Code Location

- **Agent Definitions**: `app.py` lines 372-484
- **Crew Creation**: `create_rag_crew()` function

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the CrewAI endpoint:

```bash
# Basic test
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/ask-crewai \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Who issued the Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards?"}'

# With custom top_k
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/ask-crewai \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the procurement principles?", "top_k": 10}'
```

### Compare with regular endpoint:

```bash
# Regular endpoint (fast)
time curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Who issued the standards?"}'

# CrewAI endpoint (thorough)
time curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/ask-crewai \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Who issued the standards?"}'
```
